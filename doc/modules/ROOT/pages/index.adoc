= Hazelcast for Kubernetes

This sample is a guideline on how to start Hazelcast cluster on the Kubernetes environment.

include::{templates-url}/link-to-repo.adoc[]

== What Youâ€™ll Learn

In this guide you will deploy Hazelcast cluster to Kubernetes.

== Prerequisites

1. Up and running https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] version 1.9 or higher.
* For development and testing, you may use https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[Minikube]
* You must have the Kubernetes command line tool, https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[kubectl], installed
2. Another important note would be that this document assumes some familiarity with `kubectl`, Kubernetes, and Docker.

== Deployment Steps

=== Creating Role Binding
Hazelcast uses Kubernetes API to discover nodes and that is why you need to grant certain permissions. The simplest Role Binding file looks like `rbac.yaml`. Note that you can make it more specific, since Hazelcast actually uses only certain API endpoints. Note also that if you use "DNS Lookup Discovery" instead of "REST API Discovery", then you can skip the Role Binding step at all. Read more at https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes[Hazelcast Kubernetes API Plugin].

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml
----

=== Creating Config Map
Hazelcast configuration can be stored in the Config Map. You can install it with the following command:

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f config.yaml
----

=== Creating Secret with Enterprise Key (Enterprise Only)
Hazelcast Enterprise requires the Hazelcast Enterprise License Key. You can store it as Kubernetes Secret.

[NOTE]
====
This step is not required for Hazelcast Open Source.
====

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl create secret generic hz-enterprise-license --from-literal=key=<LICENSE-KEY>
----

=== Starting Hazelcast Cluster

Finally, deploy the Hazelcast cluster:

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f hazelcast.yaml
----

For Hazelcast Enterprise, use the following command:

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f hazelcast-enterprise.yaml
----

=== Persistent Volume

This is a *prerequisite* step if you have JARs.

In order to share a custom domain JARs (for example `EntryProcessor` implementations) among Hazelcast pods, you need to add a persistent volume in Kubernetes.

There are many ways you can define and map volumes in Kubernetes. Types of volumes are discussed in the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/[official documentation].

Once you have created a volume, copy your custom Hazelcast JARs into the root volume directory and add it into the `CLASSPATH` environment variable.

In the following example a GCE Persistent Disk named "my-hz-disk" has been already created and populated with the custom configuration.

Open a text editor and add the following deployment YAML for persistent volume:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: hz-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: standard
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    - ReadOnlyMany
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  gcePersistentDisk:
    pdName: my-hz-disk
    fsType: ext4
----

Save this file as `hz-pv.yaml`. Please also notice that `Reclaim Policy` is set as `Retain`. Therefore, contents of this folder will remain as is, between successive `claims`.

Create the persistent volume:

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f hz-pv.yaml
----

Please note that contents of your previous deployment is preserved. If you change the claim policy to `RECYCLE`, you have to transfer all custom files to `<your-pv-path>` before each successive deployments.

Now edit `hazelcast.yaml`, and a PersistentVolumeClaim definition to match the above PersistentVolume. Finally, set the `CLASSPATH` env variable to a valid path and add a corresponding `volumeMount` in the `StatefulSet`. Now you apply the changes by running:

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f hazelcast.yaml
----


== Summary

This guide shows the basic setup for Hazelcast cluster for Kubernetes. You can find more advanced configurations in other Kubernetes guides.
